# JukeboxApp
Final Project CSPB 2270


My final project is a jukebox app consiting of linked lists. This provides structure and function controls for songs. These songs are nodes in doubly-linked lists and are grouped into genre playlists which are also linked to each other as doubly-linked lists. The controls functions provided include a pause/play toggle, skip, playlist rearrangement, the ability to add and remove songs and to receive a list of songs in playlist.
